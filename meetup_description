Curious about programming? Want to learn one language that you can use to build websites, program robots, visualize data, run servers, and make art? Then you're ready to get started with Python (http://www.python.org/).

Python powers some of the popular apps we all know and love (or hate), like Pinterest (http://pinterest.com) and Instagram (http://instagram.com/). It's used by tech companies all over the world, including many companies right here in Los Angeles. Employers love Python programmers.

This workshop is designed for those who have very limited or no programming experience. During this interactive workshop, we'll explore the basic components of a programming language: data types, functions, conditional statements and loops. We'll mix lecture and practice, and we'll work through lots of problems together. You'll leave the workshop with several tested tutorials to work through on your own.

We'll spend part of the workshop helping you set up a development environment, so there's no need to install software ahead of time. Just bring your laptop and come prepared to write your first lines of Python code.

VENUE
We are excited to partner with BLANKSPACES, a co-working space with venues throughout Los Angeles. BLANKSPACES & GDI will be hosting classes at all of their venues, from Long Beach to Pasadena. Our goal is to grow our community and give everyone the chance to learn, no matter where they live.

TECH REQUIREMENTS
• A laptop with a power supply.
• A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (It's free and available for both Mac and PC).

If you don't have a modern browser and text editor it may take 20 minutes to install prior to class. Please come prepared.
